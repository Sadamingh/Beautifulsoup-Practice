li: Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the
forum or mailing list you plan to post to.
li: Try to find an answer by searching the Web.
li: Try to find an answer by reading the manual.
li: Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.
li: Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.
li: Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.
li: If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading
the source code.
li: post your question to a forum where it's off topic
li: post a very elementary question to a forum where
advanced technical questions are expected, or vice-versa
li: cross-post to too many different newsgroups
li: post a personal e-mail to somebody who is neither
an acquaintance of yours nor personally responsible for solving your problem
li: Super User is for questions about general-purpose
computing. If your question isn't about code or programs that you talk
to only over a network connection, it probably goes
here.
li: Stack Overflow is for questions about
programming.
li: Server Fault is for questions about server and network
administration.
li: Any question good enough to be asked of one
developer will also be of value to the whole group.  Contrariwise, if
you suspect your question is too dumb for a mailing list, it's not
an excuse to harass individual developers.
li: Asking questions on the list distributes load among
developers.  The individual developer (especially if he's the project
leader) may be too busy to answer your questions.
li: Most mailing lists are archived and the archives are
indexed by search engines.  If you ask your question on-list and it is
answered, a future querent could find your question and the answer on
the Web instead of asking it again.
li: If certain questions are seen to be asked often,
developers can use that information to improve the documentation or the
software itself to be less confusing.  But if those questions are
asked in private, nobody has the complete picture of what questions
are asked most often.
li: 
English is not my native language; please excuse typing errors.

li: 
If you speak $LANGUAGE, please email/PM me; I may need assistance
translating my question.

li: 
I am familiar with the technical terms, but some slang expressions and
idioms are difficult for me.

li: 
I've posted my question in $LANGUAGE and English. I'll be glad to
translate responses, if you only use one or the other.

li: Send plain text mail, not HTML.  (It's not hard
to turn 
off HTML.)  
li: MIME attachments are usually OK, but only if they are
real content (such as an attached source file or patch), and not
merely boilerplate generated by your mail client (such as another copy
of your message).
li:  Don't send e-mail in which entire paragraphs are single
multiply-wrapped lines.  (This makes it too difficult to reply to 
just part of the message.)  Assume that your respondents will be
reading mail on 80-character-wide text displays and set your 
line wrap accordingly, to something less than 80.
li:  However, do not wrap data (such
as log file dumps or session transcripts) at any fixed column width.
Data should be included as-is, so respondents can have confidence
that they are seeing what you saw.
li: Don't send MIME Quoted-Printable encoding to an
English-language forum.  This encoding can be necessary when you're
posting in a language ASCII doesn't cover, but many e-mail agents
don't support it.  When they break, all those =20 glyphs scattered
through the text are ugly and distracting — or may actively
sabotage the semantics of your text.
li:  Never, ever expect hackers to be
able to read closed proprietary document formats like Microsoft Word
or Excel.  Most hackers react to these about as well as you would to
having a pile of steaming pig manure dumped on your doorstep.  Even
when they can cope, they resent having to do so.
li: If you're sending e-mail from a Windows machine, turn
off Microsoft's problematic “Smart Quotes” feature (From
Tools > AutoCorrect Options, clear the smart quotes checkbox under
AutoFormat As You Type.).  This is so you'll avoid sprinkling garbage
characters through your mail.  
li: In Web forums, do not abuse “smiley” and
“HTML” features (when they are present). A smiley or two
is usually OK, but colored fancy text tends to make people think you
are lame.  Seriously overusing smileys and color and fonts will make
you come off like a giggly teenage girl, which is not generally a good
idea unless you are more interested in sex than answers.
li: 
Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.

li: 
Describe the environment in which it occurs (machine, OS, application,
whatever).  Provide your vendor's distribution and release level
(e.g.: “Fedora Core 7”, “Slackware 9.1”, etc.).


li: 
Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem 
before you asked the question.

li: 
Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem
yourself before you asked the question.

li: 
Describe any possibly relevant recent changes in your computer or
software configuration.

li: 
If at all possible, provide a way to reproduce the
problem in a controlled environment.

li: do you have anything else to add to that?
li: oh, that's too bad, I hope you get it fixed.
li: and this has exactly what to do with me?
